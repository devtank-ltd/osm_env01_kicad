Schematic
(1) DNF: Q5, R87-R90

(2) Led THTx3 connections are opposite so cut tracks before fitting and reconnect.

(3) Fit 100k to tp55 and other side to gnd.

(4) Short cct pin 4-5 of u9.

(5) Cut track between tp19 and c25.

(6) add 20nf cap to tp37 and otherside to gnd.

(7) add 20nf across r33.

(8) swap r35 for 39k.

(9) Swap Tx/RX on the Smog Sensor

(10) Boot button fix (swap r70 for 0R) and remove c3.

(11) Add USB GPIO support for boot lines

(12) Replace anlogue switch for electric and particulate switching

(13) add switch/gnd to gpio to measure microphone refernce

PCB
(14) Check all chips have a ref for pin 1 add refernce for light chip also

(15) Make 5V track to SP05BAHT chip smaller

(16) Add ground pads for debug

(17) Make test points slightly bigger
